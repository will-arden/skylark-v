# Multi-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Compliant Processor
This repository is dedicated to a work-in-progress SystemVerilog design of a 4-stage RISC-V processor inspired by RI5CY.  
A link to the project planning interface (Notion) can be found [here.](https://boatneck-ping-f37.notion.site/Individual-Project-24f37a1b95bd4415b68c7d97c25824d7?pvs=4) It documents the journey so far!
