# Multi-Stage Pipelined RISC-V Compliant Processor
This repository is dedicated to a work-in-progress SystemVerilog design of a 4-stage RISC-V processor inspired by RI5CY.  
A link to the project planning interface (Notion) can be found [here.](https://boatneck-ping-f37.notion.site/Individual-Project-24f37a1b95bd4415b68c7d97c25824d7?pvs=4) It documents the journey so far!

### Changelog (v0.3.5)
* Register file reset bug fixed
* Latch generated by `condition_met` signal has been removed
* `BEQ`, `BNE`, `BLT` and `BGE` are fully implemented
* Fixed negative flag issue in `ALU.sv`
* `JAL` instructions now write the link address (`PC+4`) to the register file
* 3:1 multiplexer added to select the output from the Execute stage (selecting using `ExPathE`)

### To-do
* Add pipeline registers and hazard control unit
* Introduce BNN unit
